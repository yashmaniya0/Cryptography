## **Assignment 1**

This assignment is about breaking toy ciphers. The assignment has two parts.

1. In the first part, you will break substitution cipher. A randomly picked webpage has been encrypted by substituting characters by some other characters. You need to find a hidden code in the plaintext. (You will recognize it when you decrypt the text correctly.)

2. In the second part, a randomly picked plaintext has been encrypted using Vigenere cipher. You need to find the key used to encrypt and a hidden code at the end of the decrypted text (plaintext).

> I would encourage you to write your own code for solving this assignment. You will find it instructive and enjoy breaking these ciphers, if you really try it on your own. Do NOT copy others code (Although I did not bother finding out online, but there must surely be many people who would have made tools to solve such things and would have made them public. I may ask you to submit the codes as well, and will do a plagiarism check on the submissions. Therefore DO NOT use work done by others.)
